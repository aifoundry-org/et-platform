## [2.0.0]  - 2022-02-23
### Added
- [SW-15659] Added doxygen generated documentation support.
### Changed
- *** Breaking change *** [SW-15492] Updated getDramBaseAddress() and getDramSize() to provide the device-specific information.
- (Conan) Updated recipe

## [1.3.0] - 2022-01-02
### Added
### Changed
- [SW-15383] DevicePcie: Do not wait for `DeviceState` in `openWhenReady()`, the device node can only be opened now when reset is concluded. Moreover, `DeviceState` should be checked once in constructor and allowed to proceed with `DeviceState::Ready` and `DeviceState::PendingCommands`. With latter state, the user can try to recover the device using abort functionality. This change requires 0.12.0 driver version hence updating kMinReqDriverVersion=0.12.0
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
- Fixed validation check for device index in DevicePcie.
### Security

## [1.2.0] - 2022-12-07
### Changed
- (Conan) Consume sw-sysemu/0.7.0
- Unconditionally forward CMA allocation request to driver
### Deprecated
- Marked getFreeCmaMemory() as deprecated

## [1.1.0] - 2022-10-20
### Added
- [SW-14409] Added new method reinitDeviceInstance() which facilitates single device reinitialization. Note, the declaration of this interface is non pure virtual in order to not introduce a breaking change. The default implementation will throw an exception.
- [SW-14542] Added a new method hintInactivity which indicates to the device that the host does not expect activity. Currently there is only a sysemu based implementation of this API, which is useful to avoid wasting CPU cycles emulating nothing.
### Changed
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
### Security

## [1.0.0] - 2022-10-19

### Added
- [SW-14409] Added ETSOC reset flag in sendCommandServiceProcessor(). Now sendCommandServiceProcessor()/sendCommandMasterMinion() APIs use `SPCmdFlag/MMCmdFlag` in place of bool argument `isMmReset`, `isDma` and `isHighPriority` etc.
  * The use of enum `DeviceState` depends on new et_ioctl.h header.
  * Package required for this change:
    * linuxDriver/0.1.0@#9f0abce8d2566d2c178e687df7324c68
- [SW-14538] Add version compatibility check.
### Changed
- *** Breaking change *** [SW-14409] Changed dev::DeviceConfig::archRevision_ from `uint8_t` to `enum dev::DeviceConfig::ArchRevision` to be consistent with `enum dev::DeviceConfig::FormFactor`.
### Deprecated
### Removed
- *** Breaking change *** [SW-14409] Removed old sendCommandServiceProcessor and sendCommandMasterMinion
### Fixed

  * Packages supported with this change:
    * linuxDriver/0.1.0@#86ada88a12a28a47f52238641b3c9483
    * device-bootloaders/0.2.0@#6563ebf4e4e5db6ee978bf47ca112ac2

### Added
- [SW-12683] Added a check for command size in DeviceSysemu
- This changelog
- [SW-12547] Added two new APIs: getDeviceAttribute() and clearDeviceAttributes(), to access ETSoC1 device health and performance statistics through sysfs interface exposed by its Linux Driver.
### Changed
- [SW-12621] as part of IDeviceLayerFake removal, IDeviceLayerMock has also changed. Now its called
DeviceLayerMock (without the I) since its an implementation, not an interface. Also the delegation mechanism has changed, a new constructor receives a pointer to an instance of the IDeviceLayer delegate.
### Deprecated
### Removed
- [SW-12621] removed IDeviceLayerFake from deviceLayer, changed IDeviceLayerMock -> DeviceLayerMock
  * this is a breaking change, see the ticket description.
