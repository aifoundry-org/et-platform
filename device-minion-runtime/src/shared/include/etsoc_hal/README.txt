These files were all code generated by Sean Smith using Semifore, and hand-
copied here.

They were modified by hand to add "#include <stdint.h>" but otherwise
untouched.

Despite being in "shared", some of these registers can only be accessed by 
the service processor; however, hardware provides these dependencies as one
component, so they are kept together to match that export structure and be
easily updated.

Eventually, we want to automate pulling this dependency. See
