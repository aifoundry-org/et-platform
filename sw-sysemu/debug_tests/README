Disclaimer: These tests should probably be moved to dv/tests.
All tests are self-checking, but have only been tested against sysemu.
Some of these may not work with RTL (missing workarounds for erratas).
    
Two ELFs will be built: <test>.elf and <test>.spio.elf.
The service processor ELF relies on global (`g_`) variables
in the minion ELF, so there is a dependency between the two.
The service processor/minion code is mixed in the same source file.

Each test source has a heading with its sysemu arguments.
This is used as input for sysemu when running the tests.
    
Test directory structure:
    common/   Common sources/linker scripts
    include/  Header files
    tests/    Test sources
    
To execute tests
    cd debug_tests
    make -j sysemu  # Build sysemu
    make            # Build tests
    make run        # Run tests
    make run LOG=1  # Run tests with verbose logs
    make run/tests/<test>  # Run only a single test

  reset_harts.c     Test whether hart can be reset
  halt_on_reset.c   Test whether harts will halt-on-reset
  abscmd.c          Test execution from the program buffer
  progbuf_break.c   Test interaction between program buffer and breakpoints
